 We'll follow these steps:

Count how many times each number from the right list appears.
Multiply each number from the left list by its occurrence count from the right list.
Sum the results.
Example Lists:
Left List: 3, 4, 2, 1, 3, 3
Right List: 4, 3, 5, 3, 9, 3

Step 1: Count Occurrences in the Right List
3 → 3 times
4 → 1 time
2 → 0 times
1 → 0 times
Step 2: Multiply and Add
3 * 3 = 9
4 * 1 = 4
2 * 0 = 0
1 * 0 = 0
3 * 3 = 9
3 * 3 = 9
Step 3: Sum the Results
9 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 9 + 9 = 31

The similarity score is 31.
